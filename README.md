# Venice Facts

Just a basic fork of the Random Fact sample skill in the Alexa resource kit, modified to
speak trivia about Venice, and use a tiny bit of SSML in order to speak a couple
of words of Italian.

I should really have forked the original repository but the project was cobbled together
during the first UK Alexa Bootcamp. Thanks Liz!
